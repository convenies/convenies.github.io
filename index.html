								<h3>Spreadsheets and Paper</h3>
								<p>If your company is heavily relying on complex spreadsheets or even paper processes, a Workplace Innovation Platform is the solution for you. It provides you with centralized data, which is easily searchable, groupable, accessible and analysable.</p>
								<h3>Scattered Sources of Information</h3>
								<p>Your company has various data sources which is spread over different locations? This takes away your team's valuable time from what they want to focus on: adding value to your company.</p>
								<h3>Manual Data Entry</h3>
								<p>A magnificent amount of manual data entry is a wastage of precious resources and leads to frustration inside your organization. A customized Workplace Innovation Platform not only helps you to structure data but also makes room for your team's creativity.</p>
								<h3>Unique Requirements</h3>
								<p>Your business and workflows are individual. Many platforms promise the evergreen and one-and-only solution for your workplace requirements because <q>business is business</q>. Right? Of course not. We know from experience that every company is unique and faces very different challenges while still sharing economic similarities. We provide customized solutions without reinventing the wheel. Unless it may be necessary.</p>
